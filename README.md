This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution. The initial Dockerfile attempts to install Python dependencies using a requirements.txt file that is either missing or inaccessible.  The fixed Dockerfile addresses this by ensuring the requirements file is correctly copied and available during the installation process.  This example highlights the importance of carefully managing file paths and permissions within the Docker build context.
